## Project Ideas

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cybersecurity project ideas - beginner friendly<br><br>1. Password Strength Checker: Build a tool that assesses the strength of passwords by analyzing factors like length, complexity, and the presence of common patterns.</p>&mdash; Sweetly SavageðŸŒ¸ðŸ’–ðŸ”ª (@StatistaG1210) <a href="https://twitter.com/StatistaG1210/status/1776203775750889705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2024</a></blockquote> 

2. Vulnerability Scanner: Create a basic vulnerability scanner that scans a network or a web application for known vulnerabilities and reports them to the user.

3. Creating a Basic Firewall: Develop a simple firewall using Python or another programming language to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.

4. Phishing Awareness Game: Develop an interactive game or quiz that educates users about phishing techniques and how to recognize and avoid them.

5. Encrypt/Decrypt Tool: Build a simple encryption/decryption tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using common algorithms like AES or RSA.

6. Secure File Transfer Application: application that encrypts files before transferring them over the network. You can use libraries like OpenSSL for encryption.

7. Basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS): monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and alerts the user when potential threats are detected.

8. Security Log Analyzer: tool that analyzes log files from servers or applications to identify security-related events and anomalies.

9. Network Scanner: tool to identify active hosts, open ports, and services running on a network. You can use Python and libraries like Scapy for this.
