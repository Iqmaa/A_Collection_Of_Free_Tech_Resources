# Technical_writing_resource
This is a resource containing free technical writing courses and what you will learn from each of them. 

This is just a brief overview. Over time I plan of having a page with detailed summary and takeaways from each of the course to help you decide which one of them you're interested in taking and also to give those who have taken them already a refresher of each course.

*Note - The Google Technical writing course does a very good job of taking you through the general basics of technical writing and even a little bit more than that, even if you don't end up finishing the course or decide not to take it for whatever reason, the points listed above are enough to take note of to increase your technical writing skills and proficiency.                                 ~Iqma*
