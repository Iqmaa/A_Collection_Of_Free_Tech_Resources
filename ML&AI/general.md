Welcome to the Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) section. Below are some of the resources we've discovered that will prove helpful on your journey into the ML/AI field.

Good luck, and have fun!

## Websites

- Datacamp ; has a lot of courses on machine learning and AI and even specialised learning paths like 'ML Engineer with python/R' 'Python Programmer'. It will help you learn all you need to in the field of ML/AI from basic topics like python programming to more advanced ones like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and so on.
  
- Udacity ; also offers various courses in the field of data and AI. For they're nanocourses which are not free, a lot of scholarships are available yearly for those interested. e.g [Bertelsmann NextGen TechBooster Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/bertelsmann-next-generation-tech-booster), [AWS AI/ML scholarship ](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/aws-ai-ml-scholarship-program) and others.
